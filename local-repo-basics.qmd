# Local Repo Basics

## Start Version Control

To start version control in the current directory use

```sh
git init
```

Initialize a Git repository and set the name for the initial branch to be
`<branch_name>`.

```sh
git init -b <branch_name>
```

## Adding files to the staging area

Add one file to the staging area

```sh
git add <filename>
```

Add multiple files to the staging area.

```sh
git add <filename> <filename> ...
```

Add all the files in the working directory that have been edited or changed to
the staging area.

```sh
git add -A
```

## Making a commit

It’s important to note that commit is both a verb and a noun. In Git, the verb
to commit means to save something, and the noun (a commit) means a version of
our project. So, to make a commit means to save a version of a project.

To create a new commit with a commit message.

```sh
git commit -m “<message>”
```
